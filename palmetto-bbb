I’m new to solar, so I really valued how well they explained each step and helped me understand what to expect from my system. Knowing that adding panels in the future is an option if I ever need it just adds to the confidence I feel in my investment. The Palmetto team truly cares about setting up a reliable system, and I couldn’t be happier!";
